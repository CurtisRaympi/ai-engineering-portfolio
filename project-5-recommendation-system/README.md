- scikit-learn
- Pandas / NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Structure
# Recommendation System

This project builds a basic user-based collaborative filtering recommendation system using cosine similarity.  
It suggests items to a target user based on the preferences of similar users in the dataset.

**Key Features:**
- Computes user similarity with cosine similarity metric
- Aggregates ratings from top similar users for recommendations
- Handles sparse data with missing ratings (represented by zeros)
- Easy to extend with larger datasets and additional filtering methods

**Technical Highlights:**
- Uses Pandas for data manipulation
- Illustrates fundamental recommendation system concepts
- Lightweight implementation suitable for learning and prototyping

**Usage Instructions:**
- Run `main.py` to see recommendations for a sample user
- Adapt the rating matrix or integrate with real user-item data
- Expand with content-based filtering or hybrid approaches as next steps
