# Chatbot with NLP

This project implements a simple but effective chatbot using the NLTK library's pattern matching capabilities.  
It responds to user input based on predefined conversation pairs, demonstrating natural language understanding and basic AI interaction.

**Key Features:**
- Uses regex pattern matching for input recognition
- Provides multiple response options per pattern for varied conversations
- Easily extendable with new patterns and responses
- Includes reflections for more natural replies (e.g., "I am" ↔ "You are")

**Technical Highlights:**
- Built entirely in Python with the NLTK library
- Simple conversational AI demonstrating NLP fundamentals
- Lightweight and fast execution

**Usage Instructions:**
- Run `main.py` and chat directly via terminal
- Type ‘quit’ to exit the chat

This chatbot serves as a foundational project for understanding conversational AI, useful for building more complex assistants and bots.
